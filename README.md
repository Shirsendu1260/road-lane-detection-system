# Road Lane Detection System

Repository of two image processing pipelines that use Python and OpenCV to detect lanes and vehicles from a dashcam video. Here you will find not one but two different pipelines and both of them have different functionalities. The first one is a naive algorithm that uses Canny Edge Detection and Hough Transform to detect lanes. But it cannot fixes distortion caused by camera lense. And also in this case, the drawn lane lines tends to converge at some point in the video frame, which will be disastrous in real life scenario. So for that purpose, the second algorithm is proposed. It is an advanced approach to detect lanes from a dashcam video. This algorithm fixes the camera distortion issue and also the drawn lane lines doesn't tend to converge at some point. It uses Sliding Window approach to detect lanes. Both of the algorithm uses SSD MobileNet v3 architecture to detect different vehicles and draw bounding boxes. The workflow of both of the algorithm are listed below.
